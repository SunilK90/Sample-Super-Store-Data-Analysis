# Sample-Super-Store-Data-Analysis
Dashboards, visualizations for sales, profit, and discount bifurcation across category, subcategory, region, city, and state, enabling actionable insights for pricing, discount strategies, and customer segmentation. Found profit margin, top products, subcategory ranking, MoM/YoY growth, RFM segmentation, high-value orders, and manager-wise profit.

Leveraging the Sample Superstore dataset, I conducted an end-to-end Power BI analysis, starting with Power Query transformations to clean, format, and enrich the data, including calculated columns for profit margin, loss flags, and discount buckets. Using DAX, I developed measures for profit margin, top 3 selling products, subcategory ranking, MoM/YoY/quarter-on-quarter growth, manager-wise total profit, high-value orders, and RFM segmentation, along with functions like CALCULATE, SWITCH, RELATED, LOOKUPVALUE, CONCATENATE, and time intelligence functions to derive deeper insights. The analysis included sales and profit bifurcation by category, subcategory, region, city, and state, identification of high-profit and high-discount areas, and creation of profit bands to prioritize key products and customers. Visualizations and dashboards highlighted trends in sales, profit, and discounts, enabling actionable insights on top-performing products, subcategories, regions, and managers, ultimately supporting strategic decisions around pricing, discounting, and customer segmentation.
